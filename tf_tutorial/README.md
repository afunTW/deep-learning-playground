# Tensorflow Tutorial

Including tensorflow basic syntax and workflow to train / eval / predict model. Moreover, it will have some demo code or experiment when the new version of tensorflow or features come out.

## Requirement

At least, you gotta used `keras` before and knowing the way to build up the model. That will be easier to dive into the tensorflow very soon.

Environment included

- `python 3.6`
- `tensorflow 1.11.0`

Recommend to test the code in the docker image (e.g. `floydhub/tensorflow:1.11-gpu.cuda9cudnn7-py3_aws.36`)
